The application is built using **React.js** and **plain CSS** (without component or utility libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS), as per the assignment's technical requirements.

## ✨ Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts smoothly to Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile screen sizes.
* **Plain CSS:** Styled with pure CSS using media queries. No Tailwind/Bootstrap used.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Built with modular React components (`Header`, `Footer`, `Filters`, `ProductGrid`, `ProductCard`).

* **Interactive Filters:**
    * Filter categories function as accordions (expand/collapse).
    * On mobile, the entire filter sidebar can be hidden or shown.
* **Dynamic Product Grid:**
    * Displays products in a 3-column (Desktop), 2-column (Tablet), and 1-column (Mobile) layout.
    * Includes a functional "Sort by" dropdown (Recommended, Newest, etc.).
* **Product Card:** Features a clean layout with an image-swap effect on hover.
* **Minimal Dependencies:** Uses `lucide-react` for icons as the primary external library.
